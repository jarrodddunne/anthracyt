## Synopsis

MemeMe (pronounced "Meam - Me" ) is a social media/messaging app built around Microsoft Azure's platform whose main feature is taking a photo of the user and analyzing the facial expressions in this photo using Microsoft's Vision API. MemeMe then determines what captions would be funny for this photo, creates a meme using this text, and then uploads it to a social media stream or messages this image to a friend.
